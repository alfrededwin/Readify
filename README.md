# “Readify” is an app to help book readers to be organized and track their reading.
Mobile Application Development Coursework 02

Reading a book is challenging nowadays, we solve readers pain points:

  1. People read on digital devices & paper books → hence there is a need for a centralized tool
  2. Busy lifestyle → all in one app will help to be organized and productive
  3. Distracting digital noise → need a tool to get back on track to resume from where left off
